# Cross-check

Web application for study departments and faculty students.

## About

Studying at a university brings a number of administrative tasks that students are forced to complete. Many of the questions that students have naturally arise from such situations. Students could search for answers to these questions on the faculty's official communication channels, but often choose an easier option to contact the study department directly. We therefore decided to create a support information system for the study department, in which the answers to the students' frequently asked questions will be collected in one place.

We want to motivate students to first get the information themselves and contact the study department only when necessary. One of the important tasks of the study department is also the reception and processing of applications from students. Our system will partially automate this process. We believe that the information system will help study assistants in their work and also that it will make it easier for students to communicate with the faculty through the study department.
